# OnkyoRemote

This is a small hack I did to remote control my Onkyo TX-NR609.
I re-used code from Simon Aldrich's blog at http://simon.aldrich.eu/blog/tag/iscp/

I wrapped the stuff in a small Qt dialog. Now I don't need to get out of bed to adjust the volume any more \o/

# Compile and run

mkdir build<br>
cd build<br>
cmake ..<br>
make<br>
./OnkyoRemote
